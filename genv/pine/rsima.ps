// This script is an advanced variant of the Onset Trend Detector, a technical indicator for trend analysis developed by John F. Ehlers.
// It is based on a non-linear quotient transformation and expands upon Mr. Ehlers' previous studies, the Super Smoother Filter and the Roofing Filter,
// to address the lag issue common to moving average type indicators.

// The algorithm in this script registers the most recent peak value and normalizes it. The normalized value then decays slowly until the next
// peak swing. The ratio of the previously filtered value to the corresponding peak value is then transformed using a quotient transformation to
// provide the resulting oscillator.

// This script implements an indicator called "The forbidden RSI" (TFRSI). This indicator was developed by chervolino as an improvement on the
// standard Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is a technical indicator used to measure the strength of a trend and identify potential buy and sell signals.

// The TFRSI is calculated based on the close price and is typically plotted on a scale from -20 to 120, with values above 100 indicating that
// the asset is overbought (likely to decline in value) and values below 1 indicating that it is oversold (likely to increase in value). The script
// allows the user to customize the length of the RSI and the length of the trigger used to smooth the signal.

// In order to calculate the TFRSI, the script first initializes some constants and then performs a series of calculations to determine the value of
// "HP", "ag", and "Sp". The RSI value is then calculated based on the values of "X", which is based on "ag" and "Sp", and "q1", which is based on "X"
// and the trigger length. The RSI value is plotted in a chart along with upper and lower bounds and a filled region representing the background.

// Please check it out, it works perfectly to find good analysis and entries for both, longs and shorts.

// Best regards

// Chervolino
